# Mod-1-Project
The first project

Microsoft is getting into the movie business and have hired professional Data Scientists, William Adams and Dylan Karman to analyze what kind of movies will do the best. Using the Kaggle data set that included over 5,000 movies from the 1986's until 2016, we have reached the conclusions that:
  1. Movies that make the most profit are Action, and Drama.
  2. Movies that have the highest budget to make are Action movies.
  3. Action movies are the most popular.
  4. Movies rated PG-13 are the most profitable.
